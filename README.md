![3D](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martonmiklos/stlinkv3_mods_rs_485/master/docs/3D.png "3D view")

I needed to debug some RS-485 equipped STM32 based gear and I wanted to reduce the burden on my desk by using the STLink's VCP port for RS-485.

Uses ISL83488IBZ-T full duplex transceiver, with pop options it is possible to populate it with RS-422 mode.
